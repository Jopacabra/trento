   |br| Pb-Pb events generated by the model using different *p*-means

The only change here is that the program now writes eccentricities in real and imaginary parts to event file and stdout as:

[event_number, impact_param, npart, mult, e2_re, e2_im, e3_re, e3_im, e4_re, e4_im, e5_re, e5_im]

or, if enabled:

[event_number, impact_param, npart, ncoll, mult, e2_re, e2_im, e3_re, e3_im, e4_re, e4_im, e5_re, e5_im]


HDF5 output is configured to retain the original keys e2, e3, etc. as the magnitude using the original function, as in the original release.

All other functionality should be identical... Usage searches were performed, but no guarentees! :)
